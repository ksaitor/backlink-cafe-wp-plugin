### Backlink Cafe Features
- Escrow. Making sure you are paid for guest posts and links you host on your site.
- You have full controll over how much you'd like to get paid per link and guestpost.
- Accept and reject each post individually.
- You have full controll over what's going on with your blog and content.

### How does this pluging work exactly?
1. Once the plugin is installed and activated, it will register itself with our API on https://backlink.cafe/. Only your domain name and main administrator email is shared at this step.
2. The plugin then crawls and indexes all your published posts, so that our API is able to match your content with the best backlinks and guest posts available.
3. To adjust your link insertion and guest post price you can visit Settings page in Backlink Cafe Plugin in your WordPress Dashboard. You have full control over how much you'd like to be paid.
4. Each time you visit the Backlink Cafe plugin in your WordPress Dashboard, it will fetch latest opportunities available for your website.
5. If you see an opportunity you like, just click "Accept". Backlink Cafe will automatically place that link or guest post into your site. We recommend you submit it via Google Webmaster Tools for faster indexing.
6. Once an updated content is indexed, you'll receive funds from escrow within 7 to 15 days. We are constantly adjusting this period to ensure best fair use.

### Security
We take security seriosly. The plugin designed in a way that only your WordPress administrator is able to make adjustments to its settings, accept or reject content offers. The plugin does not expose any endpoints, making it insisible to all crawlers or other parties.


### Don't trust. Verify.
This is why we are open sourcing our plugin.
